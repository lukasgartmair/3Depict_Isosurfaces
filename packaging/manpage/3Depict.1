.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics,

.SH OPTIONS
This program has no command line options, other than a sequence of files to open, or an XML file containg the previous program state (this may be generated from within the program's graphical interface). Currently the program can read "POS" (position) formatted files, which are simply uncompressed sequences of 4-byte floats (IEEE 597) in (x,y,z,value) form. All other work is done through the graphical interface.
