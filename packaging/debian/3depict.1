.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B 3Depict command
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics,
.\" respectively.
\fB3depict\fP is a program that allows for visualisation and analysis of point datasets with associated spectral data.
.PP
Note that the program is a best-effort system. It is by no means guaranteed that the algorithms in this program are free form errors in implementation, or follow conventions for any specific user-application. 
.SH OPTIONS
This program has no command line options, other than a sequence of data or XML files to open, the XML files being containing a previous program state (this may be generated from within the program's graphical interface). Currently the program can read "POS" (position) formatted files, which are simply uncompressed sequences of 4-byte floats (IEEE 597) in (x,y,z,value) form. All other work is done through the graphical interface.
.PP
As a further note, the XML file format has not been stabilised for the 0.0.x series; and may change between revisions
