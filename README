If you want the manual, or a "how to use" for this program, See the web
page for the latest documentation, at http://threedepict.sourceforge.net.

Most users should obtain a "binary" version from the website. If you are
trying to build from source, the webpage is recommended, but otherwise,
install the required dependencies (see website for more details) and then,
from the command-line run:

./configure 
make 
make install

to build the default-mode (single-threaded, debug on ) program. 

Interesting configure flags (see ./configure --help):

--enable-openmp-parallel : Enable multi-CPU mode (for multi-CPU sections
 				of the program) via the "openMP" framework
--disable-debug-checks : Disable debug checks. This makes the program
				much faster, but less likely to catch
				program bugs
