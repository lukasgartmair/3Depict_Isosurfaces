If you want the manual, or a "how to use" for this program, See the web
page for the latest documentation, at http://threedepict.sourceforge.net.

Most users should obtain a "binary" version from the website. If you are
trying to build from source, the webpage is recommended, but otherwise,
install the required dependencies (see website for more details) and then,
from the command-line run:

./configure 
make 
make install

to build the default-mode (single-threaded, debug on ) program. 

Interesting configure flags (see "./configure --help" for more options):

--enable-openmp-parallel : Enable multi-CPU mode (for multi-CPU sections
 				of the program) via the "openMP" framework
--disable-debug-checks : Disable debug checks. This makes the program
				much faster, but less likely to catch
				program bugs
--disable-ubsan : Disable undefined behaviour santiser. Makes the program
			go faster, but undefined program behaviour (bugs)
			will not be as readily detected
--enable-experimental-cpp11 : Enables experimental C++11 support.

Some Dependencies:
	libxml2
	qhull
	gsl
	ftgl 
	mathgl
	libpng
	wxwidgets
	gettext
	vigra
	

	Remember, for dependencies under linux platforms you must install
	the -dev, or -devel packages, in order to allow compilation

	For those with no idea how to install the dependencies, you can
	*try* running the "getDeps.sh" script in the packaging/deps/
	folder, but it is not guaranteed to work on your system.

	For those under Windows, we recommend to install a different
	OS (eg debian, ubuntu - maybe in a Virtual machine) then
	"cross-compile". This is not trivial, but you can look at the
	deps/mingw-debian-cross/bootstrap.sh script as a starting point.
