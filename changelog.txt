	small for cols<4, resulting in memory overflow
	- Fix bug in transform filter where data limits were required for
	ion data sizes < 2
	- Fixes for spatial analysis filter
		- Catch and report errors to console, rather than crash.
	- Fixes to plot bound get function with multiple plots
		- Only returns visible plots now
	- Fix aspect ratio not set during scene overlay draw
	- Added export analysis package
	- Added abort to rendering sequence
	- Fix assertion error during refresh due to bad total filter count
	after ion export
	- Fix bug in BoundCube::setBounds where incorrect assignment for z
	was made
	- Valgrind out two crash bugs due to uninitialised memory



* September 24, 2010: 0.0.2

	- Files with arbitrary number of data channels can now be loaded,
	but only one channel at a time can be analysed.
	- Many functions are now openMP parallelised, and thus will
	take advantage of multiple CPUs, if enabled at compile time
	- Simple animation support (PNG sequences in an orbit)
	- Voxelisation support; voxel data can be generated using the new
	Voxelise filter. Supported visualisation methods are Isosurfaces and
	point clouds.
	- Undo/redo support : filter operations can now be undone, and redone.
	- Windows build: we now have a windows build.
	- Improved rangefile parsing. This should now work on every range file
	I have ever met. If you have one where it does not work, let us know.
	- Several filters have been improved to be easier to use (eg transform
	filter)
	- Some core functions have been optimised (eg rotation, composition
	profiles), and should be significantly faster.
	- Many bugfixes -- program should be significantly more stable, but
	requires testing (please help us with this if you can )

* August 11, 2010 : Released 0.0.1
	- Initial release
