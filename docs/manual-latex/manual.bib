  Abstract                 = {The applicability of the binomial frequency distribution is outlined for the analysis of the evolution nanoscale atomic clustering of dilute solute in an alloy subject to thermal ageing in 3D atom probe data. The conventional v2 statistics and signiﬁcance testing are demonstrated to be inappropriate for comparison of quantity of solute segregation present in two or more different sized system. Pearson coefﬁcient, l, is shown to normalize v2 with respect to sample size over an order of magnitude. A simple computer simulation is implemented to investigate the binomial analysis and infer meaning in the measured value of l over a series of systems at different solute concentrations and degree of clustering. The simulations replicate the form of experimental data and demonstrate the effect of detector efﬁciency to signiﬁcantly underestimate the measured segregation. The bino- mial analysis is applied to experimental atom probe data sets and complementary simulations are used to interpret the results.Microsc. Res. Tech. 71:542–550, 2008. VC 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACT Nanoscale atomic clusters in atom probe tomographic data are not universally defined but instead are characterized by the clustering algorithm used and the parameter values controlling the algorithmic process. A new core-linkage clustering algorithm is developed, combining fundamental elements of the conventional maximum separation method with density-based analyses. A key improvement to the algorithm is the independence of algorithmic parameters inherently unified in previous techniques, enabling a more accurate analysis to be applied across a wider range of material systems. Further, an objective procedure for the selection of parameters based on approximating the data with a model of complete spatial randomness is developed and applied. The use of higher nearest neighbor distributions is highlighted to give insight into the nature of the clustering phenomena present in a system and to generalize the clustering algorithms used to analyze it. Maximum separation, density-based scanning, and the core linkage algorithm, developed within this study, were separately applied to the investigation of fine solute clustering of solute atoms in an Al-1.9Zn-1.7Mg (at.%) at two distinct states of early phase decomposition and the results of these analyses were evaluated. },
