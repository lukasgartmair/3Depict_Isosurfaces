  abstract = { ABSTRACT Nanoscale atomic clusters in atom probe tomographic data
	are not universally defined but instead are characterized by the
	clustering algorithm used and the parameter values controlling the
	algorithmic process. A new core-linkage clustering algorithm is developed,
	combining fundamental elements of the conventional maximum separation
	method with density-based analyses. A key improvement to the algorithm
	is the independence of algorithmic parameters inherently unified
	in previous techniques, enabling a more accurate analysis to be applied
	across a wider range of material systems. Further, an objective procedure
	for the selection of parameters based on approximating the data with
	a model of complete spatial randomness is developed and applied.
	The use of higher nearest neighbor distributions is highlighted to
	give insight into the nature of the clustering phenomena present
	in a system and to generalize the clustering algorithms used to analyze
	it. Maximum separation, density-based scanning, and the core linkage
	algorithm, developed within this study, were separately applied to
	the investigation of fine solute clustering of solute atoms in an
	Al-1.9Zn-1.7Mg (at.%) at two distinct states of early phase decomposition
	and the results of these analyses were evaluated. },
