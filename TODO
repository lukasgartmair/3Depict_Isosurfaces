TODO List - worlds simplest bugtracking system 

--Packaging--
	* Improve windows build
		- Detection of MSYS path? (how?)
		- better instructions for installing msys? (this is
		complicated and subject to change :( )
				
	* Improve build system
		- Obtain builders for other OSs?

--Main app--
	To Implement:
		* Better about box
		* Expose hide origin to user for transform filter 
		* Front-to back alpha blending ordering support for
		scene drawing of non-pointcloud objects
		* DTD (Document type descriptor) for state files, to
		  specify a consisted statefile structure
			- How to ensure version compatibility in future
			state files?
		* Pos region loading is currently not exposed to user.
		* Billboard text
		* XYZ axis overlay
		* VTK/xyzm output
		* XML Export (with rel. paths changed to be rel. to file)
		* Better error handling in the XML file read
		* Interactive range file in plot
		* Colourbar overlay for ion colour
		* Ion exchange filter
		* Slab clip filter
		* Plot needs to be able to scroll/pan

	Outstanding bugs:
		* Optimised normal computation for raw triangles -> isosurface 
		* Option to warn on file overwrite with save after merge (default off)
		* Fix various hard-to-generate crash bugs
		* Improve camera framework -- orthogonal camera
		* Grid copy/ctrl-c doesn't seem to work under GTK. The data gets
		  passed to the clipboard, but then wx doesn't appear to
		  do anything with it...
			- Could be constrained to wxGTK2.8 or less (
			 wxWidgets Bug Ticket #11811 ??? )
		* K3DTree currently requires public access to members of boundcube
		* Error bar masking for graph (mathgl draws error bars outside plot boundary)
		
	Performance:
		* Pos limit loader could alter its behaviour when
		 sampling rates some percentage to be determined (load
		 file, skip buffer).
	
	Misc:


-- Refactor/cleanup --
	* work out which inline FIXMEs and TODOs are still valid, and need attention
	* Re-arrange source to reduce compile-time interdependence (bad .h file arrangement?)
	* I have multiple colour classes floating about. might be an idea to unify them.
	* Camera code is largely unused due to perpsective only
	 camera. Might be an idea to remove inheritence and instead unify
	the camera classes
