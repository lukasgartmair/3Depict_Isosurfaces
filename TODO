TODO List - worlds simplest bugtracking system 

--Packaging--

--Main app--
	Fix Needs testing:
		* Windows' .3Depict folder should be hidden on creation
	To Implement:
		== Next version ==

		== Eventually == 
		* Binomial? (MM edition)
		* Improved resolution dialog (Easy fix, but needs time/thought)
		* Stream information filter (Easy fix, but needs time/thought)
		* Polynomial error estimator in graph
		* Shear-warp volume render mode for voxels
			- This can be broken into two useful stages
				(1) transfer function editor, could be tested with point cloud mode
				(2) Volume render code (check out SMVIS, Author gave perm. under GPLv3+)
		* Ion exchange/explode filter
		* DTD (Document type descriptor) for state files, to
		  specify a consistant statefile structure
			- How to ensure version compatibility in future
			state files?
		* VTK/xyzm output
		* BB cache for ion data?
		* Option to warn on file overwrite with save after merge (default off)
		* Theora video?
		* Multiple selection in filter tree for many to one stash/unstash operations
		* We are using too many timers. There are limits to max. timers (win32?).
		* Front-to back alpha blending ordering support for
		 scene drawing of non-pointcloud objects
		* Voxelisation filter needs progress
		* Better progress during cluster ranging
		* Clipping should be parallelised
		* Billboard text
		* Voxel export dialog 
		* Camera animation control (slerp?)
		* Undo by timestream
		* MD5sums could be used on filter input to determine cache-refreshingness! (clever!)
		* Per ion type ion display sizes?
		* Stats bar message queue
		* Support for XY scatter plots

	Outstanding bugs:
		== Next release==
		* Windows complains if .3Depict folder is missing on startup (after install? Fixed?)
		* Windows crash on startup bug -- seems to happen after
		  locale init, maybe openGL related (there was a second
		  opengl program running at the time - context problem???)
		* Drag and drop under windows fails
		* Voxelisation filter & ion sampler filter show ions disabled in upstream range
		* Voxelisation "filter" option appears to be reducing voxel intensity
			
		== Eventually==
		* Scroll wheel on text area for camera drop down does
		  not scroll cameras; only on button (wxGTK only??)
		* Switching between fixed width and num bins in voxel
		  repeatedly causes "drift" of values -- aliasing errors?
		* Colour bar drawing broken when tiling an output image
		* Loading a full pos file directly onto the video card cannot be aborted.
		* Error bar masking for graph (mathgl draws error bars outside plot boundary)
		* Pos load add could always add to bottom of filter list,
		 rather than default value
		* Grid copy/ctrl-c doesn't seem to work under GTK. The data gets
		  passed to the clipboard, but then wx doesn't appear to
		  do anything with it...
			- Could be constrained to wxGTK2.8 or less (
			 wxWidgets Bug Ticket #11811 ??? )
		* Under mac osx, changing languages does not cause stock
		  wx translation strings to change, even after app restart.
		* Select an X-Y crop, camera coords, on a dataset,
		  then view   target  (-9.14237,-0.995174,83.2904) origin
		  (188.23,-0.995174,83.2904). Now press ctrl+space. Note
		  dataset disappears until mouse motion. This is due to
		  camera up vector not being updated, I suspect.
		* Bar plots do not work (under windows?) for composition profiles
			(Is this fixed?)
		* Text bounding boxes are wrong.
		* Cylinder unit test fails.
		* Range file drag/drop ignores drop coordinates; this could be useful
		  in trying to interpret where the user wants to drop the object

		== Needs reproducing ==
		* Invalid range file being opened cause Package export to crash
		* Data files when failing to load, do remove, but are put back at next program load	
		* Windows appears to have weird front-back drawing behaviour for point clouds.
		* Debian user reports unconditional segfault in libmgl during STIX font parse.

		* Duplicate range at end when exporting range
		* Large datasets causing crash?
		* Ion transform leaking memory??


	Auditing:
		== Next release ==
		* Check each filter is actually reporting the required cache memory

	Performance:
		* Scene is sometimes continuously refreshed during post effects, causing CPU usage
		  to max out.
		* Clipping sphere/cylinder does BB test? (only useful if we have bb cache)
		* Pos limit loader could alter its behaviour when
		 sampling rates some percentage to be determined (load
		 file, skip buffer).
		* Clustering could be paralellised, but is complex. Split & weld along KD tree lines using 
		  cluster BB interactions.
		* Examine performance characteristics of HULL_GRAB in ioninfo
	
	Misc:


-- Refactor/cleanup --
	* Interaction code needs to be cleaned up. Currently it is a substatiative hack.
		- Viscontrol should store a copy of the original tree,
		  then periodicially compare it to the current tree. if it
		  is different, then it should invalidate the caches for
		  the different bits, and then force a refresh. This would allow for removal 
		  of the callback mechanism that is currently in use
	* work out which inline FIXMEs and TODOs are still valid, and need attention
	* I have multiple colour classes floating about. might be an idea to unify them.
	* K3DTree currently requires public access to members of boundcube






--- Upstream/External problems I can't solve---
