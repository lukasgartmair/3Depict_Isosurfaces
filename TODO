TODO List - worlds simplest bugtracking system 

--Packaging--
	* Improve windows build
		- Detection of MSYS path? (how?)
		- better instructions for installing msys? (this is
		complicated and subject to change :( )
				
	* Improve build system
		- Confirm out-of-the-box support of OS-X?
		- Obtain builders for other OSs?

--Main app--
	To Implement:
		* Front-to back alpha blending ordering support for
		scene drawing of non-pointcloud objects
		* DTD (Document type descriptor) for state files, to
		  specify a consisted statefile structure
			- How to ensure version compatibility in future
			state files?
		* Pos region loading is currently not exposed to user.
		* redo stack 
		* Billboard text
		* XYZ axis overlay

	Outstanding bugs:
		* Grid copy/ctrl-c doesn't seem to work. The data gets
		  passed to the clipboard, but then wx doesn't appear to
		  do anything with it...
			- Could be constrained to wxGTK2.8 or less (
			 wxWidgets Bug Ticket #11811 ??? )
		* Some IVAS emitted range files have a string after their
		  colour specification, which causes range parser to fail
		* Stashes are not correctly loaded from state files,
		  resulting in assertion errors in the stash manager.
		* K3DTree currently requires public access to members of boundcube
		
	Performance:
		* Ion sampler could reverse its behaviour when sampling rates > 50%.
		* Pos limit loader could alter its behaviour when
		 sampling rates some percentage to be determined (load
		 file, skip buffer).
	
	Misc:
		* Write an isolated testing framework for a given input
		 statefile to ensure that filters do not leak.


-- Refactor/cleanup --
	* work out which inline FIXMEs and TODOs are still valid, and need attention
	* Re-arrange source to reduce compile-time interdependence (bad .h file arrangement?)
	* I have multiple colour classes floating about. might be an idea to unify them.
