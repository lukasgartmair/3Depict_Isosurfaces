* May 16, 2011  : 0.0.6
	Features:
	- Text data file loading
	- Cameras can now be locked
	- Add noise mode to transform filter (gaussian/white)

	User Visible Bugfixes/Changes:
	- Clustering algorithm now gives sensible results. 
		- Previous implementation was wrong in several respects. Now
		  should behave correctly, even on corner cases.
		- Now performs bounds-in-sphere check for large queries,
		  significantly improving the scaling characteristics of
		  the search when using large bulk link radii
	- Fix error in plot causing assertion error during mouseover
	- Fix plot behaviour when all data == 0.
	- Fix crash when moving range on empty data 
	- Workaround for wxWidgets bug where recent file list >9 items
	  would not load
	- Fix incorrect "loaded file" message if uninterpretable pos file
	  loaded.
	- Fix bug in undo/redo where tree may not reset correctly if it
	  contains range data after undo/redo op.
	- Fix opengl bug with isosurface draw which appears up under some
	  video card/driver combinations, which lead to undefined video
	  behaviour (bad glPopAttrib()/glEnd() ordering)


	Technical Bugfixes/Features:
	- Signficantly more complex refresh system, now performs type analysis
	  on tree to determine minimal subsections of tree to refresh. Now filters
	  that cannot cache well will penalise the refresh system much less.


* March 27, 2011  : 0.0.5

		- Modification of methods of Stephenson et al.; this
		includes Max. Sep algorithm. See manual for algorithm

	User Visible Bugfixes/Changes:
	- Add hint to resolution dialog to maintain aspect ratio in output plots by default
	- Mac binary now distributed through packagemaker.

	Technical Bugfixes/Features:
	- Major code refactor; simplify code layout to aid further code development, speed compilation
	- Fix "press shift to refresh" hint not working
	- Fix voxels not reporting cache size
	- Fix possible crash bug in double click plot when no plot visible.
	- Filters now support named sections in property sets
	- Disallow zero sized ion streams from rangefiles	
	- Fix off-by-one bug in boundcube set func (can cause assertion error)
	- Improve progress reporting for LSFR random selections

	- Postprocessing effects
		- Interactive/fast depth buffer based cropping
		- Analgyphic (oldschool coloured glasses) stereo
	- Fullscreen now has "partial" and "really" fullscreen modes
	- Ion downsampling filter now aware of ranges


	User Visible Bugfixes/Changes:
	- Improved parsing of points, so more styles of 3D point entry is 
	allowed, eg when cutting/pasting from scilab
	- Plot now zooms in X or Y only by double clicking below axis
	- Some sections that were supposed to be paralellised, but were not
	due to typos, now actually are.
	- Fix bugs in state file writing for ion clipping (non saved var)
	- Fix parallelism in KD tree building
	- RDF was not paralellised, and could not be aborted
	- Voxels no longer crash due to non-ion input
	- Fix assertion errors when working with cylinder clipping tools
	- Fix overlays hints being drawn "below" other points in the scene (disable
	depth buffer, and draw last)

	
	Technical Bugfixes/Features:
	- Improve compilation structure to simplify builds under all
	platforms, particularly when using paralell or similar
	- Various crash fixes due to re-entry bugs
	- Fix a few unititalised variables (eg spat. analysis ->cache on plot)
	- Implement "effects" framework to allow insertion of arbitrary openGL
	calls using derived effects classes.
	- Some internal refactoring to reduce code duplication (Filter
	generation)
* November 29, 2010 : 0.0.3

	Features:
	- Added range interaction on-plot
	- Show marker for transform in mass-centre && boundbox mode. Allow
	user to show or hide marker.
	- Add drag and drop support for files
	- Add on-screen colourbar  for ion colour
	- Add axis drawing
	- Added better error messages to XML file read
	- Added RDF filter
	- Add mode to lock cylinder magnitude during rotation
	- Plot panning (hold shift key)
	- Filters can report stepwise progress
	- Improvements to manual.

	User Visible Bugfixes:
	- Better error messages for PNG/SVG plot save
	- Fix bug in binding which caused object to move more than it should
	 during 3D drag
	- Set dialog default item focus
	- Fix escape key not working in dialogs
	- Switch ms-windows camera roll to use alt, rather than tab, because
	ctrl+tab advances through controls, regardless of focus
	- Remove buggy parallel code in rotation filter
	- Fix transform filter behaviour to +origin after rotate
	- Fix bugs in transform filter
		- origin behaviour
		- copying/stashing filter
	- Fix bug whereby region colours in mass spectrum had green and blue
	channels swapped (typo)
	- Fix for crash when exporting images at high resolutions,
	due to uncaught std::bad_alloc in conjunction with a missing return
	after popping up dialog box
	- Fix bug with loading multiple files at command line
	- Fix bug in voxels where axis aligned data caused crash
	- Fixed animation tiling 
	- Ensure visibility reset actually resets to looking down +ve axis
	- Change plot axis to show log_10 rather than just log() during log
	mode
	- Fixed interaction overlay drawing transparancy

	Technical Bugs/Features:
	- Really fast "random" sampling.
	- Fix memory leak where textures were continually reloaded at every
	use due to bad name handling
	- Fix incorrect usage of std::unique that was leading to assertion
	failure
	- Make conjugation in quaternions implicit for even faster quat
	rotations.
	- Fix bug in GenericLoadFloatFile, where the output vector was too
	small for cols<4, resulting in mem overflow
	- Fix bug in transform filter where data limits were requirested for
	ion data sizes < 2
	- Fixes for spatial analysis filter
		- Catch and report errors to console, rather than crash.
	- Fixes to plot bound get function with multiple plots
		- Only returns visible plots now
	- Fix aspect ratio not set during scene overlay draw
	- Added export analysis package
	- Added abort to rendering sequence
	- Fix assertion error during refresh due to bad total filter count
	after ion export
	- Fix bug in BoundCube::setBounds where incorrect assignment for z
	was made
	- Valgrind out two crash bugs due to uninited mem



* September 24, 2010: 0.0.2

	- Files with arbitrary number of data channels can now be loaded,
	but only one channel at a time can be analysed.
	- Many functions are now openMP parallellised, and thus will
	take advantage of multiple CPUs, if enabled at compile time
	- Simple animation support (PNG sequences in an orbit)
	- Voxelisation support; voxel data can be generated using the new
	Voxelise filter. Supported visualisation methods are Isosurfaces and
	point clouds.
	- Undo/redo support : filter operations can now be undone, and redone.
	- Windows build: we now have a windows build.
	- Improved rangefile parsing. This should now work on every range file
	I have ever met. If you have one where it does not work, let us know.
	- Several filters have been improved to be easier to use (eg transform
	filter)
	- Some core functions have been optimised (eg rotation, composition
	profiles), and should be significantly faster.
	- Many bugfixes -- program should be significantly more stable, but
	requires testing (please help us with this if you can )

* August 11, 2010 : Released 0.0.1
	- Initial release
