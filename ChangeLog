* The Future : 0.0.3

	Features:
	- Added range interaction on-plot
	- Show marker for transform in mass-centre && boundbox mode. Allow
	user to show or hide marker.
	- Add drag and drop support for files
	- Add on-screen colourbar  for ion colour
	- Add axis drawing
	- Added better error messages to XML file read
	- Added RDF filter
	- Add mode to lock cylinder magnitude during rotation
	- Plot panning (hold shift key)
	- Filters can report stepwise progress
	- Improvements to manual.

	User Visible Bugs:
	- Better error messages for PNG/SVG plot save
	- Fix bug in binding which caused object to move more than it should
	 during 3D drag
	- Set dialog default item focus
	- Fix escape key not working in dialogs
	- Switch ms-windows camera roll to use alt, rather than tab, because
	ctrl+tab advances through controls, regardless of focus
	- Remove buggy parallel code in rotation filter
	- Fix transform filter behaviour to +origin after rotate
	- Fix bugs in transform filter
		- origin behaviour
		- copying/stashing filter
	- Fix bug whereby region colours in mass spectrum had green and blue
	channels swapped (typo)
	- Fix for crash when exporting images at high resolutions,
	due to uncaught std::bad_alloc in conjunction with a missing return
	after popping up dialog box
	- Fix bug with loading multiple files at command line
	- Fix bug in voxels where axis aligned data caused crash
	- Fixed animation tiling 
	- Ensure visibility reset actually resets to looking down +ve axis
	- Change plot axis to show log_10 rather than just log() during log
	mode
	- Fixed interaction overlay drawing transparancy

	Technical Bugs/Features:
	- Really fast "random" sampling.
	- Fix memory leak where textures were continually reloaded at every
	use due to bad name handling
	- Fix incorrect usage of std::unique that was leading to assertion
	failure
	- Make conjugation in quaternions implicit for even faster quat
	rotations.
	- Fix bug in GenericLoadFloatFile, where the output vector was too
	small for cols<4, resulting in mem overflow
	- Fix bug in transform filter where data limits were requirested for
	ion data sizes < 2
	- Fixes for spatial analysis filter
		- Catch and report errors to console, rather than crash.
	- Fixes to plot bound get function with multiple plots
		- Only returns visible plots now
	- Fix aspect ratio not set during scene overlay draw
	- Added export analysis package
	- Added abort to rendering sequence
	- Fix assertion error during refresh due to bad total filter count
	after ion export
	- Fix bug in BoundCube::setBounds where incorrect assignment for z
	was made
	- Valgrind out two crash bugs due to uninited mem



* September 24 : 0.0.2

	- Files with arbitrary number of data channels can now be loaded,
	but only one channel at a time can be analysed.
	- Many functions are now openMP parallellised, and thus will
	take advantage of multiple CPUs, if enabled at compile time
	- Simple animation support (PNG sequences in an orbit)
	- Voxelisation support; voxel data can be generated using the new
	Voxelise filter. Supported visualisation methods are Isosurfaces and
	point clouds.
	- Undo/redo support : filter operations can now be undone, and redone.
	- Windows build: we now have a windows build.
	- Improved rangefile parsing. This should now work on every range file
	I have ever met. If you have one where it does not work, let us know.
	- Several filters have been improved to be easier to use (eg transform
	filter)
	- Some core functions have been optimised (eg rotation, composition
	profiles), and should be significantly faster.
	- Many bugfixes -- program should be significantly more stable, but
	requires testing (please help us with this if you can )

* August 11 : Released 0.0.1
	- Initial release
